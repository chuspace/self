title: Hello World
summary: Down the rabbit hole and back

In 2015, I started dabbling into the blogging space through [medium.com](https://gauravtiwari.medium.com/). In my opinion, Medium was the first simple and readable blogging platform. They got everything right except the editor, which wasn’t built for sharing code. I had to embed GitHub gists, which was very clunky and time-consuming.

The initial idea for Chuspace was very much inspired by medium with a better editor that understands markdown and highlights code with community contributions. Often, we read posts on topics that have stale content and I thought if we could have something like *“Github for blogging“* that would solve the problem. People can submit *“Revisions“* and keep content up to date.

With that in mind, I started building the first version around the start of 2018 👇

But with a full-time job in hand, it took me almost two years to build the platform, and when you spend that much time you lose track. In the end, I built this complex platform with Git hosting, which wasn’t needed. It was all very well reasoned though, like having Git built-in would make onboarding easier. People don’t have to connect external repositories, which adds an extra step - *UX and so on.*

I felt a bit lost and didn’t want to lose any more time, so decided to stop working and achieved the repository and it’s been like that up until the end of last year.

Last year, I was reading something and I noticed **content freshness and fragmentation** are still a problem. I thought, how about, if I build something that allowed people to connect their existing blogs hosted anywhere. That way, you own the content and design of their blog and get a community of readers who can help maintain content freshness.

And that’s what this new **Chuspace** is all about. **Chuspace is a collaborative blogging platform for programmers and teams. *Offering***,

* 💪 True content and design ownership

* 🔌 Works with any static site framework that speaks markdown

* 📙 Multiple team publications

* 🙌 Community reviews and contributions *(in development)*

* 🌐 Custom domains and blog hosting  *(in development) aka Github Pages*

**How is this different?** 

Well, Chuspace works completely differently compared to all other blogging platforms. It starts with what you have and not what you must create or migrate to get started. You own your blog content, design and look and hosting provider - 100%.

Plus, you can help create a community where we all can share and learn together and make content better through revisions.
