title: Hello World
summary: Down the rabbit hole and back
---

In 2015, I started dabbling into blogging world through [medium.com](https://gauravtiwari.medium.com/). I think it was the first time I started writing and all credit goes to Medium. In my opinion, Medium was the first really simple and readable blogging platform. They got everything right except the editor, which wasnâ€™t built for writing code.

The initial idea for Chuspace was to build a platform similar to medium with a better editor that understands markdown and highlights code. I started building the first version around start of 2018 ðŸ‘‡

But with a full-time job in hand it took me almost two years to build the platform and I guess when you spend that much time with something it sort of turns into something else. There is no way to backtrace and keep hold of the idea.

In the end, it felt like I over did it - it was some sort of hybrid between Github and Medium and honestly, I wasnâ€™t happy. So, I thought well lets put an end to this thing and I archieved the repository. One good thing was that, I wasnâ€™t very attached to it so it didnâ€™t hurt plus I learned a lot building the platform - openssh, go lang, crystal.

Last year while retrospecting I realised I made a huge mistake by building everything whilst it could have been a really simple platform
